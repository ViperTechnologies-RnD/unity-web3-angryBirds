<h2>Welcome ðŸ‘‹</h2>

This is the Unity sample project for the Web3 Angry Birds.

You will find two scenes:

MintNFT scene --> Mint NFT using SmartContract and transfer it to wallet address.
Game scene --> Angry Birds game. Your character will be a local image or the image retrieved from the NFT ðŸ˜„
As a demo project it is thought to be run in the Editor.

You can download the repo as a ZIP file or just clone it using git cli <br>

inside the MintNftController.cs you can change the abi, contract address, and so on in case you want to
deploy your own contract.
a copy of the contract is already inside the project and you can paste it inside the REMIX IDE.


Enjoy!
